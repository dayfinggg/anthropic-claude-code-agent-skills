# Figure it out

When the task matches no playbook, design one. The deliverable before any code is the workflow itself: a sequence of phases that scales rigor to the task, runs the scientific method, and leaves a decision trail a human can audit after stepping away.

## Start

Open the session's task list, in the user's language, whose first step is to read the Principles section of the **poteto-mode** skill. Then add the phases below as short steps.

## Phase A: Frame

Ground first, then commit. Don't start the run until you can state:

- The definition of done as a falsifiable predicate.
- Scope, quantified: rough units and effort, plus the blockers grounding surfaced.
- The rigor level, biased high. One-way doors and high blast radius get more. Reversible low-stakes steps get less. Rigor is gates and artifacts, not "try harder".

Write the framing and its tradeoffs as the first rows of the decision trail (Phase D). Reversible work proceeds without asking. Ask the user once, with a single AskUserQuestion call before the run starts, only when the framing holds a decision only the user can make, such as a product or preference call no experiment can settle. Under a full-autonomy grant ("going to bed", "don't stop", "be fully autonomous") skip the question, apply a sensible default, and record it in the trail.

## Phase B: Design the workflow

Decompose into atomic, independently-landable units. Sequence riskiest-unknown-first. Scaffold and verification come before features.

- Build the verification harness before the work, with the baseline captured from the pre-change state, so the check reads as "old value vs new value".
- For one-way-door design decisions, run the **architect** skill (it runs **arena**). Skip it for mechanical work whose shape is already concrete. A second arena over a settled design is over-engineering.
- Decide what fans out. Parallelize only across seams, and give each worker its own worktree (`isolation: "worktree"`) or branch (the **separate-before-serializing-shared-state** principle skill). Don't over-fan. Pick each subagent's model and effort for the job, per the Models table and the Subagents section of the **poteto-mode** skill.
- Write the designed phase list into the decision trail. That list is what the human reviews.

Then execute the design. Add its steps to the task list as concrete steps between the Phase C and Phase D steps. Run each under the Phase C loop discipline, and weave the Phase D log through them, a row as each step lands, rather than saving the whole trail for the end.

## Phase C: Run the loop

Each unit is an experiment. State the hypothesis, make the smallest change, measure against the predicate on the real artifact, keep it if it advanced, revert it if it didn't. Apply the **sequence-verifiable-units** principle skill, verifying each unit before starting the next instead of batching checks at the end.

- Verify by inspecting the artifact, never a self-report. When something passes too easily, suspect the observation method before the system.
- Pair delegated work with a judge. If a worker games the gate, reset and harden the contract. If the gate itself is wrong, fix the gate as its own step, logged in the trail, rather than routing around it.
- A verdict is VERIFIED, NOT VERIFIED, or INCONCLUSIVE. Inconclusive is not a pass. Don't hide a negative.

## Phase D: Keep the audit trail

Log the run via the **show-me-your-work** skill. When the user's request asked for commits or a PR, figure-it-out's work is usually ambitious enough to commit the trail so the reviewer can read it in the PR. Otherwise it stays in the session's scratchpad and the answer names its path. The trail plus the diff is what lets the human come back and trust the work.

## Phase E: Verify and hand back

Check the whole against the Phase A predicate on the real product, not just the harness. Encode any recurring correction as a gate, a lint rule, a check, or a script.

**Reply:** in the session's output style, open with what's verified against the predicate, then the playbook you designed, the rigor level and why, the decision-trail path, and what's still open.
