## OpenTelemetry defaults

- Semantic conventions 1.45.0 (2026-11-02) are current. Stable areas: HTTP, RPC including gRPC (1.45), database client spans and `db.client.operation.duration`, the resource attributes `service.name`, `service.namespace` and `service.instance.id` (1.40), `deployment.environment.name` (1.41), and a core set of `k8s.*` attributes (1.42). Messaging is still in development.
- Use the stable attribute names: `http.request.method`, `http.response.status_code`, `db.system.name`, `db.namespace`, `db.operation.name`, `db.collection.name`, `db.query.text`. `http.method`, `http.status_code`, `db.system`, `db.name`, `db.operation`, `db.sql.table` and `db.statement` are deprecated.
- Set `deployment.environment.name`, not the deprecated `deployment.environment`, and use the well-known values `production`, `staging`, `test` or `development` whenever one applies.
- GenAI conventions moved to the `open-telemetry/semantic-conventions-genai` repository in 1.42 and have no tagged release yet. Pin a commit and treat them as unstable.
- Instrumentations that emitted pre-stable HTTP, database or RPC conventions keep emitting them in their current major version. Set `OTEL_SEMCONV_STABILITY_OPT_IN=http,database,rpc` to switch, or use the `/dup` forms such as `http/dup` to emit both while dashboards migrate.
- Spec defaults: `OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER=parentbased_always_on`, `OTEL_PROPAGATORS=tracecontext,baggage`, the `otlp` exporter for traces, metrics and logs, and a 60000 ms metric export interval. `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` wins over `service.name` inside `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES`.
- OTLP uses port 4317 for gRPC and 4318 for HTTP. The spec default protocol is `http/protobuf`, but SDKs that shipped gRPC first may keep it, so set `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL` and the port together.
- For file-based SDK setup, point `OTEL_CONFIG_FILE` at a YAML file (configuration schema 1.0.0 since 2026-02, 1.2.0 now). `OTEL_EXPERIMENTAL_CONFIG_FILE` is deprecated.
- Emit new events and exceptions as log records through the Logs API, correlated with the active span. The Span Event API (`AddEvent`, `RecordException`) is being deprecated since 2026-03 (OTEP 4430).
- Export over OTLP. The Zipkin exporter spec is deprecated since 2025-12, and Jaeger exporters were deprecated earlier.
- Signal status per SDK changes often. Logs are stable in Java, .NET, C++, PHP and Rust, and in JavaScript since SDK 3.0 (2026-11-05, requires Node.js 22.15+). Go logs are a release candidate, Python and Ruby logs are in development, and Rust traces are beta.
- Run the `otelcol-k8s` or `otelcol-contrib` distribution, or a custom OCB build, when you need `k8sattributes` or `tail_sampling`. The core `otelcol` image lacks both.
- Batch in the exporter instead of the `batch` processor, which was deprecated on 2026-11-11. Exporter batching becomes the default in v0.171.0 (planned 2027-02), the processor is removed in v0.177.0 (planned 2027-05), and v0.165.0 warns when a pipeline uses both. Use the `queue_batch` processor if batching must stay in a processor.

```yaml
exporters:
  otlp:
    sending_queue:
      enabled: true
      batch:
        enabled: true
```

- Put `memory_limiter` first in every pipeline and set `GOMEMLIMIT` to about 80% of the Collector's memory limit.

## OpenTelemetry gotchas

- Since Collector v0.104.0 the OTLP receiver listens on `localhost:4317` and `localhost:4318` by default, so other containers and pods cannot reach it. Set `endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317` or `endpoint: ${env:MY_POD_IP}:4317`.
- Write environment variables in Collector config as `${env:VAR}`, with a default as `${env:VAR:-value}`. Bare `$VAR` has not been expanded since v0.104.0, and `$$` writes a literal `$`.
- The Collector `logging` exporter was removed. Use the `debug` exporter.
- When `OTEL_CONFIG_FILE` is set, the SDK ignores every other `OTEL_*` variable unless the file references it through `${VAR}` substitution. Start from `otel-sdk-migration-config.yaml` in the `opentelemetry-configuration` repository to keep env-driven settings working.
- With the default ParentBased sampler, a public-facing service obeys the sampled flag in callers' `traceparent` headers, so external clients decide whether it records traces. Set `OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER=always_on` at the edge and sample in the Collector.
